# This is the official Android 2.3 Lockscreen taken from AOSP 2.3 Sources

It's the first time I work directly on Android Souces, so I don't know how to correctly import this code into an Android Studio project and release it as an App.
If someone has resources that explain how to work on Android Sources, please contact me on Telegram (@mik_el_telegram) or send me a mail
